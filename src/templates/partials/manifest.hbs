  /*=================================*\
  Welcome on my website.
  Let me introduce myself ...
  I am outlaw, rebel, misfit.
  I hustle, copy, hack, provoke and pivot.
  Welcome to my world ...

  The Hacker Ethic:
  - Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something
    about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total.
    Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
  - All information should be free
  - Mistrust authority—promote decentralization
  - Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees,
    age, race, sex, or position
  - You can create art and beauty on a computer
  - Computers can change your life for the better
